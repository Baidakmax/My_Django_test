# My_Django_test
# First introductory project on django, during the project I learnt how to configure and use such things:
# Django-rest-framework, Postman, Debug Toolbar, Redis, Celery, PuTTY, FileZilla, PostgreSQL.
# But in the course of training and familiarisation it becomes clear that the main thing is a base of python, 
# knowledge of English, read and correctly understand the documentation of each library and program. 
# Memorisation is not suitable in the work of a programmer. The ability to find a solution and eliminate errors is equally important.
